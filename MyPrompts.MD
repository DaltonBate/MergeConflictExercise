prompt:
What is a class in C#

response:In C#, a class is a fundamental building block of object-oriented programming (OOP). It serves as a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of that class. A class defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will possess.

Here's a basic example of a class in C#:public class Car
{
    // Properties
    public string Make { get; set; }
    public string Model { get; set; }
    public int Year { get; set; }

    // Constructor
    public Car(string make, string model, int year)
    {
        Make = make;
        Model = model;
        Year = year;
    }

    // Method
    public void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The car is starting...");
    }
}
In this example:

Car is the name of the class.
Make, Model, and Year are properties of the class that define its attributes.
Car(string make, string model, int year) is the constructor of the class. It's a special method that is called when an object of the class is created. It initializes the properties of the object.
Start() is a method of the class. It defines a behavior of the class, which is to start the car.
You can create objects of this class and access its properties and methods like this:Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022);
Console.WriteLine($"My car is a {myCar.Year} {myCar.Make} {myCar.Model}");
myCar.Start();
This will create a new Car object, set its properties, and then print out information about the car and start the car.
